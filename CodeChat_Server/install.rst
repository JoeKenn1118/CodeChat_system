To install the CodeChat System, install the CodeChat Server and a CodeChat extension or plugin, along with optional external renderers you desire.

.. _install CodeChat Server:

CodeChat Server Installation
============================
To install the CodeChat Server:

Windows
-------
#.  Install Python. There are two options:

    #.  Install it from the `Windows Store <https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P7QFQMJRFP7>`_.
    #.  Install Python from the web; check the "Add Python 3.x to PATH" box during the installation by following `these instructions <https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/>`_.

#.  Click `this link <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scarbroughzach/CodeChat_system/master/CodeChat_Server/windows_installer.ps1>`_

#. When this opens the powershell script in a new page, right click and save as the webpage

#. remove the ".txt" extension from the file save bar so that it reads only "windows_installer.ps1" and change the file type to "all files"

#. go to this file in file explorer, right click, and run in powershell


Linux
-----
#.  Run *OUR POWERSHELL SCRIPT*



Mac
---
#.  Run *OUR POWERSHELL SCRIPT*




CodeChat extension/plugin installation
======================================
Install a `CodeChat plugin or extension <../extensions/contents>` to use the CodeChat System (the final required step of the installation steps above).


Renderers
=========
Renderers transform a textual source document into HTML, which the CodeChat System can then display. The CodeChat System `includes several renderers <included renderers_>`_; you may also optionally install `additional renderers`_.

Included renderers
------------------
The CodeChat Server includes built-in renderers for `reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_, `Markdown <https://www.markdownguide.org/>`_, and (x)HTML; simply open any ``.rst``, ``.md``,  or ``.(x)htm(l)`` document and see it rendered live! In addition, the built-in `CodeChat <https://codechat.readthedocs.io/>`_ renderer allows you to transform source code in `many languages <https://codechat.readthedocs.io/en/master/CodeChat/CommentDelimiterInfo.py.html#supported-languages>`_ to a beautifully-formatted web page; likewise, simply open a source file to see it rendered live.

Additional renderers
--------------------
The CodeChat System has (limited) support for `Pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`_. Install this and ensure it's in the path; the CodeChat Server will then use it to render a wider range of files.

The CodeChat System also works with project-based external renderers, by providing a CodeChat project configuration file (`example <../codechat_config.yaml>`) for that renderer. The ``templates/`` directory provides templates demonstrating a basic project for the following external renderers; each template includes the correct CodeChat project configuration file.

.. Docs note: since the ``conf.py`` for this project includes the ``templates/`` directory in the ``html_static_path`` list, then all the third-party build docs are copied there after a build. Hence, the paths to ``../static``.

Templates
^^^^^^^^^
-   `Doxygen <https://www.doxygen.nl/>`_ (`rendered template <../_static/doxygen/_build/html/index.html>`__)
-   `Javadoc <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc>`_ (`rendered template <../_static/javadoc/_build/index.html>`__)
-   `Mdbook <https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/>`_ (`rendered template <../_static/mdbook/book/index.html>`__)
-   `Mkdocs <https://www.mkdocs.org/>`_ (`rendered template <../_static/mkdocs/site/index.html>`__)
-   `PreTeXt <https://pretextbook.org/>`_ (`rendered template <../_static/pretext/_build/index.html>`__)
-   `Runestone Components <https://runestone.academy/>`_ (`rendered template <../_static/runestone/build/runestone_template/index.html>`__)
-   `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_ (`rendered template <../_static/sphinx/_build/index.html>`__) -- note that this documentation is produced using CodeChat with Sphinx; see `../codechat_config.yaml` and `../conf.py`.

To use these templates:

#.  Install the external renderer.
#.  Make a copy of the appropriate template. These files are available via `Github <https://github.com/bjones1/CodeChat_system/tree/master/CodeChat_Server/CodeChat_Server/templates>`_, installed with the CodeChat Server via ``pip``/your favorite Python package manager, and also available via the "show source" link on these web pages.
#.  Open a file from the copied template in the CodeChat System to edit and render them.

To use the CodeChat System with an external renderer not listed above:

#.  Install the desired external renderer.
#.  Create a new project following the external renderer's instructions.
#.  Place a CodeChat project configuration file at the root of this newly-created project.
#.  Open any file supported by the external renderer in this newly created project. The CodeChat System will automatically render it.
